<!-- 1. To run the site, you simply open the index.html file.
2. JS Uses - 
    a) I used a framework called 'lax.js' for the scroll animation (Hobbies Section).
    b) I used vanilla JS also for the audio player.
    c) validateForm function, that validates that the user entered the required information before it allow to open the user's email program. I know that I could also use the 'required' attribute in the HTML, but I wanted to show you that I know how to do that with JS as well.
    d) Humburger menu for the mobile view.

    I used JQUERY alternately to show uses of it.


    I entered a little bit of fake biography on me in that about me section, so dont panic LOL.
